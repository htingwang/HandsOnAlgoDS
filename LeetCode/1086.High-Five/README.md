1086. High Five


Given a list of scores of different students, return the average score of each student's top five scores in the order of each student's id.

Each entry items[i] has items[i][0] the student's id, and items[i][1] the student's score.  The average score is calculated using integer division.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]

Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]

Explanation: 

The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division their average converts to 88.
 

Note:

1 <= items.length <= 1000
items[i].length == 2

The IDs of the students is between 1 to 1000

The score of the students is between 1 to 100

For each student, there are at least 5 scores
