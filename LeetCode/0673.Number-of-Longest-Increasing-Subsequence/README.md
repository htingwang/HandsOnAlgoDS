673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence


Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,4,7]

Output: 2

Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2,2,2]

Output: 5

Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
Note: Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
