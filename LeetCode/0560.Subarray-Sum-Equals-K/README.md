# 560. Subarray Sum Equals K


Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Example 1:

```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2

```

Note:
- The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
- The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].
