644. Maximum Average Subarray II


Given an array consisting of n integers, find the contiguous subarray whose length is greater than or equal to k that has the maximum average value. And you need to output the maximum average value.

Example 1:

Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4

Output: 12.75

Explanation:

when length is 5, maximum average value is 10.8,

when length is 6, maximum average value is 9.16667.

Thus return 12.75.

Note:

1 <= k <= n <= 10,000.

Elements of the given array will be in range [-10,000, 10,000].

The answer with the calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.
