307. Range Sum Query - Mutable


Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.

Example:

Given nums = [1, 3, 5]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 9

update(1, 2)

sumRange(0, 2) -> 8

Note:

The array is only modifiable by the update function.

You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is distributed evenly.
