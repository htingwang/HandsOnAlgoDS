1087. Brace Expansion


A string S represents a list of words.

Each letter in the word has 1 or more options.  If there is one option, the letter is represented as is.  If there is more than one option, then curly braces delimit the options.  For example, "{a,b,c}" represents options ["a", "b", "c"].

For example, "{a,b,c}d{e,f}" represents the list ["ade", "adf", "bde", "bdf", "cde", "cdf"].

Return all words that can be formed in this manner, in lexicographical order.

 

Example 1:

Input: "{a,b}c{d,e}f"

Output: ["acdf","acef","bcdf","bcef"]

Example 2:

Input: "abcd"
Output: ["abcd"]
 

Note:

1 <= S.length <= 50
There are no nested curly brackets.

All characters inside a pair of consecutive opening and ending curly brackets are different.
