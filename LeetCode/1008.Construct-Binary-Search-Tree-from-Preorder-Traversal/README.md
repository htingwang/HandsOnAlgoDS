# 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal

Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.

(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of node.left has a value < node.val, and any descendant of node.right has a value > node.val.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.)

 

Example 1:

```
Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
```
 

Note: 

- 1 <= preorder.length <= 100
- The values of preorder are distinct.
