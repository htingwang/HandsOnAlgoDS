# 410. Split Array Largest Sum


Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

Note:
If n is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ m ≤ min(50, n)
Examples:

```
Input:
nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
m = 2

Output:
18
```

Explanation:
```
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
